 # Instalation tutorial
 
  First, we need to download stuff. Download the cheat file from [releases](https://github.com/stikosek/SGC-brofallscheat/releases)

  Once we have that download we need to download bepinex6 IL2cpp
  You can download it from [here](https://builds.bepis.io/projects/bepinex_be).
     On that website you need to scroll down a bit and in the Artefacts section 
     open the latest build and download the file showed on this image:

   Once we have everything downloaded put the files on your desktop nad open steam go to your library and 
   right click BroFalls > Manage > Browse local files

   A folder will open. You need to take the .zip bepinex file and place it into the folder opened by steam.

   once the folder is there right click it and extract the file. This is important.
   Once the file is extracted you need to start the game. Once the game is started close it.
   We do this beucase we need files to generate.
   Then after you do that go to the newly generated "Bepinex" folder then go to "plugins" and then
   we need to drag the SECOND .dll file into there.

    Once you do that you can close the folder and your finished!
    Start the game and enjoy.
